                    One of our core strengths is our fully integrated in-house IT division, our logistics management
                    solutions, which, thanks to optimal flexibility,
                    allows us to quickly and efficiently customize our IT systems to fully respond to the specifics
                    requirements of our client's own IT systems. We aim to maximize
                    integration of the core IT processes within the supply chain between logistics provider and our
                    client and seek out the smoothest and most efficient integration
                    at the system interface. This is done through our full-customizable, sector-first ‘Predator’
                    software platform which can integrate add-on functions such as
                    external stock checking, customs, taxation, shipping or movements. Our system is able to track parts
                    in correlation with the consumption of the plant, based on a made-to-order process.

                    In another sector-first, we can manage specific sub-assembly or assembly operations within the
                    chain. Our flexibility and expertise base allows us to maximize our
                    warehousing space and sequencing operations to remove certain secondary tasks from the client’s
                    assembly plant. Sub assembly that we current carry out includes wheel
                    and tire fitment and balancing, subframe initial assembly with additional components and partial
                    door assembly. These components are then delivered into the supply
                    chain ready for final integration, having removed non-essential task burdens from the assembly
                    plant, freeing up capacity and with cost reductions.
